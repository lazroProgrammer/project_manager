# Project manager app

A Flutter app that manage projects by adding to them segment(UI/UX, db, business Logic...), in each segment you have tasks that have a list of todo items, this app was mainly done as a challenge for me to complete and learn Getx, drift and animations in 10 days, and it was a success 

## Features

- âœ… Add, edit, and delete Projects, segments, tasks and todos
- ðŸ“… Manage projects with timestamps.
- ðŸ”„ Persistent storage with sqflite using drift
- ðŸ“¡ Good looking UI and Animations

## Tech Stack

### Packages used
- Getx
- drift
- SharedPreferences
- Logger
- riverpod (was used just for darkmode, was occupied to fix it, it takes 5 minutes to fix but okay)

### Notice:

this project contains some minor and uneffecting bugs conserning the animations and the UI, I did it just for learning, if anyone uses it and he finds any bugs, open an issue, if i return to it i will fix them all
